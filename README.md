Building a testing framework for the Hypergraph applications.

As we develop our testing procedures, the flow or template for the same will be documented in this readme doc.

Testing will be conducted through: 
  * usability tests which will focus on features per PATCH, MINOR, and MAJOR release
  * a feedback form which will allow users to voluntarily provide feedback on any aspect of their user experience
  * occasionally, we may send out surveys which may be general or feature-specific
  * interviews may also be conducted (?)
  
  
  * We want to make testing fun so users and volunteers don't find it burdensome, so we'll try to incorporate 'thumbs-up' or 'clap' buttons. Pop-ups may be employed to alert users to new features.
  * Easter eggs could be incorporated t
  * We'll provide testers with reports on how their feedback was incorporated.
  * Moreover, we want to publicly appreciate their contributions so we will include their names (unless they want to remain anonymous) in a credit roll within our testing reports / release documentation.

One testing idea is to maintain two releases at the same time, a stable & beta version, that users can toggle between and provide feedback on.
